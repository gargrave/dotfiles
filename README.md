# My dotfiles

Pretty self-explanatory, I think? Probably not much of interest here. Mostly just ZSH config.

## Setup

Sym-link everything into the appropriate location:

- ZSH Main Config
  - `ln -s ~/[src-path]/.zshrc ~/.zshrc`
  - `source ~/.zshrc`
- ZSH Custom Theme
  - `ln -s ~/[src-path]/gargrave.zsh-theme ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes/gargrave.zsh-theme`
- ZSH Custom Plugins
  - `ln -s ~/[src-path]/gargrave-aliases.plugin.zsh ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/gargrave-aliases/gargrave-aliases.plugin.zsh`
